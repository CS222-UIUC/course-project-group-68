# course-project-group-68

## Summary of Presentation
* Our website was our original idea, as lines have always been inconvenient for us to deal with. Linecheck is a user-driven website used to update the wait times of popular bars and restaurants in Champaign. Through information crowdsourcing, users can actively update the information of their location to inform others about wait times at certain businesses.
